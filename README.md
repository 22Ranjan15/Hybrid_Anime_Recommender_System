## ⚙️ Model Development and Selection
The recommendation system uses a hybrid approach combining:

1. **Collaborative Filtering:** Identifies similar users and recommends anime titles they've enjoyed

2. **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends anime based on similar features (genre, studio, theme)

3. **Hybrid Model:** Combines both approaches for more accurate recommendations


Key highlights from the model development process:
* Data preprocessing included handling missing values and encoding categorical features

* The system addresses the cold-start problem by incorporating content-based recommendations

* Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and user satisfaction metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.10
* Google Cloud SDK
* Docker
* Kubernetes (optional for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hybrid-Anime-Recommender-System.git
   cd "Hybrid Anime Recommender System"
   ```

2. Set up your Google Cloud credentials:
   > ?? Follow the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) for instructions.

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   * Create a [`.env`](.env ) file and add necessary environment variables like:
     * GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_your_google_cloud_credentials.json

### Usage

1. To run the Flask web application locally:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will be accessible at **`http://localhost:5000`**

2. To build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t anime-recommender-app .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 anime-recommender-app
   ```
   The application will be accessible at **`http://localhost:5000`**.

3. To deploy to Kubernetes:
   ```bash
   # Create a secret for GCP credentials
   kubectl create secret generic gcp-credentials --from-file=key.json=/path/to/your/gcp-key.json
   
   # Apply the deployment
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment

The application is deployed on Google Cloud Platform. Specific services used include:

- **Google Cloud Storage:** Used for storing and accessing data files and models

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** Used to deploy and orchestrate the containerized application

- **Google Container Registry (GCR):** Used to store and manage Docker container images

### Deployment Architecture

- The Flask application is containerized using Docker and pushed to **Google Container Registry**

- **Google Kubernetes Engine** deploys the containerized application using the configuration in [`deployment.yaml`](deployment.yaml )

- The application communicates with **Google Cloud Storage** to access anime data and trained models

- Load balancing and scaling are handled automatically by Kubernetes

## 📈 Performance

The hybrid recommendation system achieves:

- **Recommendation Relevance:** High match between recommended anime and user preferences

- **Response Time:** Fast recommendation generation (typically under 2 seconds)

- **Cold Start Handling:** Effective recommendations even for new users with limited history

The system continuously improves as more user data becomes available.
